### Lesson 9.19 Clustering Features
The features used by the clustering algorithm are salary and exercised_stock_options.

### Lesson 9.20 Deploying Clustering
The two clusters do not divide the data into equal size groups, but do seem to divide the data logically.

### Lesson 9.21 Clustering with 3 Features
Adding total payments as an input feature causes 4 of the points originally belonging to the cyan colour cluster to switch to the blue cluster. This leaves just one data point in the cyan cluster.

### Lesson 9.22 Stock Option Range
The minimum value for exercised stock options in the data set is 3,285 and 34,348,384 is the maximum.

### Lesson 9.23 Salary Range
The minimum value for salary in the data set is 477 and 1,111,258 is the maximum.

### Lesson 9.24 Clustering Changes
After the performed feature scaling, only two points (originally belonging to the blue cluster) have changed the cluster they belong to (to the cyan cluster).
