### Lesson 8.15 Identify the Biggest Enron Outlier
The key corresponding to the biggest outlier in the Enron dataset is "TOTAL".

### Lesson 8.16 Remove Enron Outlier?
Although this outlier (the total of all the other data points) is relevant data, we do not want to include it in our regression.

### Lesson 8.17 Any More Outliers?

### Lesson 8.18 Identifying Two More Outliers
The two other outliers with salary of at least $1M and bonus at least $5M are SKILLING JEFFREY K and LAY KENNETH L.
