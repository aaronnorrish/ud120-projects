### Lesson 10.15 What Kind of Scaling
MinMaxScaler was the scaling algorithm used in the last part of the K-Means Clustering project.

### Lesson 10.16 Computing Rescaled Features
The value of a rescaled salary feature of $200,000 would be 0.179976207145, and for an exercised_stock_option of $1,000,000, 0.0291134511597.

### Lesson 10.17 When to Deploy Feature Scaling
If we wanted to cluster based on "from_messages" and "salary" then feature scaling would be critical, as the salary values would be many orders of magnitude greater than that for from emails.
